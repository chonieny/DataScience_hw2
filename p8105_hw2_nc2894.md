# Problem 1

Clean the Mr. Trash Wheel dataset

``` r
trashweel_df =
  read_xlsx("./data/trashwheel_data.xlsx", 
          sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel",
          range = cell_cols("A:N")) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na(dumpster) %>%
  mutate(
    sports_balls = round(sports_balls),
    sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls))
```

# Problem 2

# Clean the NYC Transit dataset, convert variable types

``` r
transit_df = read.csv("./data/transit_data.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  select(c(line:entry, vending, ada)) %>%
  mutate(entry = recode(entry, 'YES' = TRUE, 'NO' = FALSE)) 
```

Short paragraph about the dataset: This dataset shows information
regarding each entrance and exit for each subway station in New York
City. Some of the imporant variables present in the dataset are ‘Station
Name’, ‘Line’, ‘Routes’, ‘Vending’, ‘ADA’, ‘Entry’, and ‘Entrance Type’.
The dataset has 1868 rows and 19 columns. In order to clean the data, so
far I have attempted to format the variable names more consistently and
selected the columns that I need most. I also turned the ‘entry’
variable from character type to a logical variable. However, the data in
the dataset are not tidy yet because the route number and route name are
still kept as the same variable.

Answer 1 of the dataset:

there are 12816 distinct stations.

# Stations that are ADA compliant

``` r
transit_df_ada = filter(transit_df, ada == TRUE)
```

Answer 2 of the dataset:

there are 1971 stations that are ADA compliant.

# Station entrnaces/exits without vending

``` r
transit_df_novend = filter(transit_df, vending != 'YES')
```

# Station entrances/exists without vending that allow entrance

``` r
transit_df_novend_entry = filter(transit_df_novend, entry == TRUE)
```

Answer 3 of the dataset:

37.7% of station entrances/exits without vending allow entrance.

# Reformat the data

``` r
transit_df_reformatted = 
  transit_df %>%
  mutate(
    route8 = as.character(route8),
    route9 = as.character(route9),
    route10 = as.character(route10),
    route11 = as.character(route11)) %>%
  pivot_longer(
    route1:route11,
    names_to = "route_number",
    values_to = "route_name")
```

# Distinct stations that serve the A train

``` r
transit_df_A = filter(transit_df_reformatted, route_name == 'A')
```

Answer 4 of the dataset:

There are 672 distinct stations that serve the A train.

# ADA compliant stations that serve the A train

``` r
transit_df_A_ada = filter(transit_df_A, ada == TRUE)
```

Answer 5 of the data set:

Of the stations that serve the A train, 107 are ADA compliant.

# Problem 3

# Clean the data in pols-month.csv

``` r
pols_month = read.csv("./data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/pols-month.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  separate(mon, into = c('year', 'month', 'day'), sep = '-') %>%
  mutate(month = as.numeric(month)) %>%
  mutate(month = month.abb[month]) %>%
  mutate(year = as.integer(year)) %>%
  mutate(president = case_when(
    prez_gop == 0 ~ 'dem',
    prez_gop == 1 ~ 'gop',
    prez_gop == 2 ~ 'dem')) %>%
  select(-c(prez_gop, prez_dem, day)) %>%
  relocate(year)
```

# Clean the data in snp.csv

``` r
snp_df = read.csv("./data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/snp.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  separate(date, into = c('month', 'day', 'year'), sep = '/') %>%
  mutate(month = as.numeric(month)) %>%
  mutate(month = month.abb[month]) %>%
  mutate(year = as.integer(year)) %>%
  relocate(year)
```

# Clean the data in unemployment.csv

``` r
unemployment_df = read.csv("./data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/unemployment.csv") %>%
  pivot_longer(
    Jan:Dec,
    names_to = "month",
    values_to = "unemployment") %>%
  janitor::clean_names()
```

# Join the datasets

``` r
snp_pols_df = left_join(pols_month, snp_df, by = c("year", "month")) 

final_df = left_join(snp_pols_df, unemployment_df, by = c("year", "month"))
```

Short paragraph about these datasets:

First, the pol-month dataset contains information about the number of
politicians who are democratic or republican at any given time. Second,
the snp dataset shows information regarding the Standard & Poor’s stock
market index on any given date. Lastly, the unemployment dataset
contains information about the percentages of unemployment in a given
month of certain years. The final resulting dataset contains all the
information from these three individual datasets merged together by the
common variables of ‘year’ and ‘month’. The dimensions of the resulting
dataset are 822 rows and 12 columns. The range of the years covered in
this final dataset is 2015 - 1947 years, which is 68 years.  
This dataset contains the following variables - close, day, gov\_dem,
gov\_gop, month, president, rep\_dem, rep\_gop, sen\_dem, sen\_gop,
unemployment, year. Among these variables, some of the key variables are
‘year’, ‘month’, ‘president’, ‘unemployment’, and ‘close’.
